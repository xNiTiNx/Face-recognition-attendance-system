# Face-recognition-attendance-system
The Facial Recognition Attendance System automates attendance by identifying individuals through facial recognition. Built using Python and SQL, it captures and matches faces in real-time, reducing manual effort and errors. This project enhanced my skills in computer vision, OpenCV, and efficient data management.

# Features
Real-time facial recognition for attendance tracking
Automated attendance marking
Integration with SQL for efficient data storage and management
User-friendly interface and smooth operation
